- 👋 Hi, I’m @MariaKruglyak
- 👀 I’m interested in the possibilities for art in the digital space.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CSS and how to make logos.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a passion project, culturala. It's an art theory journal + digital exhibition space reconnecting artists, writers, thinkers, developers, designers and so on. We're building a community where you can speak about art plainly, directly and without all the jargon. How it's meant to be spoken about. If you're keen to join, drop me a line on the address below:
